# Stopwatch
An HTML and JavaScript Stopwatch that converts seconds into HH:MM:SS format. 

Change the variable time to change what stopwatch the timer starts at. 

Feel free to add the pause,stop, and reset buttons.

Note that the timer may be a bit fast, but it can be adjusted by changing the milliseconds on the "setTimeout" in "start()" and "hoursAdjust".
